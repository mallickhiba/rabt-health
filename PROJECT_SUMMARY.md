# Project Summary: Rabt Health

*   **What problem does your AI solution address?**
    Rabt Health addresses the critical communication gap in healthcare caused by language barriers, particularly in multilingual regions like Pakistan. It enables doctors and patients who speak different languages to communicate effectively during clinical encounters, reducing the risk of misdiagnosis and improving patient understanding.

*   **Who benefits from it?**
    *   **Healthcare Providers (Doctors, Clinicians):** They can provide more accurate care to a diverse patient population without needing a human translator. The automated generation of SOAP notes from the conversation also significantly reduces their administrative workload.
    *   **Patients:** They can describe their symptoms and concerns in their native language and receive clear, translated medical instructions, leading to better comprehension, adherence to treatment plans, and improved health outcomes.

*   **What are the inputs and outputs?**
    *   **Inputs:**
        1.  Real-time audio streams (voice) from the doctor and the patient.
        2.  Text or voice notes from the doctor containing patient instructions.
        3.  The full conversation transcript for generating clinical notes.
    *   **Outputs:**
        1.  Real-time, on-screen text transcriptions and translations for both speakers.
        2.  Synthesized audio (text-to-speech) of the translated text.
        3.  A structured SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) note generated from the conversation transcript.
        4.  Simplified and translated patient instructions sent via WhatsApp as both text and a voice note.

*   **Why is it unique?**
    Rabt Health is unique because it provides a complete, real-time, multi-modal communication loop within a single clinical workflow. It doesn't just translate; it transcribes, translates, generates clinical documentation (SOAP notes), and creates simplified, multi-format patient instructions (text and audio) for delivery. Its focus on regional languages in Pakistan and integration with WhatsApp for patient communication makes it a highly practical and accessible solution for its target environment.

*   **Type of model used (e.g., image classification, NLP, regression)**
    The application primarily uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for its core functionality:
    *   **Speech-to-Text (STT):** For transcribing live audio.
    *   **Text-to-Text Generation / Translation:** For language translation, generating SOAP notes, and simplifying instructions.
    *   **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** For creating audio voice notes for patients.

*   **Libraries or tools used (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, etc.)**
    *   **Genkit:** A framework from Google for building production-ready AI flows.
    *   **Google's Gemini Models:** Used for advanced reasoning tasks like SOAP note generation and instruction clarification.
    *   **ElevenLabs API:** Utilized for high-quality, real-time speech-to-text and multilingual text-to-speech capabilities.
